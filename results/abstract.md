### **Abstract**

This analysis examines localized temperature fluctuations in the *Planck* 2048-resolution SMICA full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map using a 3σ statistical threshold to isolate anomalous pixel clusters. Approximately **0.3 %** of all 50.3 million pixels (≈153,122) exhibited statistically significant deviations from the mean, representing localized energy irregularities in the primordial radiation field.

The strongest cluster of anomalies was detected near **(θ ≈ 98° – 99°, φ ≈ 87° – 88°)**, corresponding to the **Orion–Eridanus border region** of the galactic sphere. These findings are consistent with previously observed cold-spot asymmetries but display tighter clustering and greater magnitude than expected from Gaussian random field noise.

Within the framework of the **Holographic Entropic Receipt Theory (HERT)**, these clusters are interpreted as *entropic compression nodes*—regions where residual information from prior universal states may have imprinted coherence discontinuities into the CMB. The anomalies may thus represent structural echoes of the early holographic initialization process.

### **Notes**

* This dataset complements *Planck* 2018 CMB products and may serve as a reference for future non-Gaussian structure studies.
* Further HERT modeling may explore whether entropic imprinting correlates with baryon asymmetry or early quantum decoherence thresholds.
* The anomalies identified here are proposed under the provisional designation:
  **MOBLEY-HERT Anomalous Cluster Group 1 (MHAC-1).**
